### search filter

Currently, zed editor does not have search filter settings, you can filter files from global search as follows:
1. Open global search (`ctrl-shift-f`)
2. click on filter-icon
3. past file-path regex in 'Exclude' section: `env/*, *lock.yaml, *svg, *json, *factory.ts, *css`

### update settings

View global settings:
- `zed: open default settings`

Update global settings:
- `zed: open settings`

Update project settings:
- put settings in `.zed/settings.json` file of the project to update settings for the project

---
### update keymap

View default keymaps:
- `zed: open default keymap`
- `vim: open default keymap`

Update global keymaps:
- `zed: open keymap file`

### remove cache
- this helped when there was suddenly a blank-space on left and right side of main editor
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/zed/db
```
