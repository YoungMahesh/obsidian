# 1. download: https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior/blob/develop/ext/on-modify.timewarrior
# 2. copy file to `~/.task/hooks/`
# 3. chmod +x ~/.task/hooks/on-modify.timewarrior
task diagnostics # verify activation under hooks-section

timew summary '<task-description' # get total time of task will be tracked on `task start <id>` and `task stop <id>`
```
