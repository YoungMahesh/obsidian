In programming, declaration refers to introducing a variable, function, class or other entity to the program - basically telling the compiler or interpreter **what something is**, but not necessarily giving it a value or implementation yet.

A declaration specifies
- name of entity
- type (if applicable)
- sometimes shape (like parameters of function)

A declaration does not always allocate memory or assign a value

| Definition  | Actually create the thing in memory  | `int x = 10;` |
