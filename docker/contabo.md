### problem
Suddenly, server-access is slowed due to full CPU, Memory usage on server.
This issue can be experienced 
- when contabo dashboard login is quick but ssh-connection taking a long time
- `htop` logs on server shows full usage CPU and Memory

**Solution**: 
1. Restart VPS server from contabo dashboard
2. Crypto hackers may have hacked server for crypto-mining, hence reset passwords, ssh-keys
