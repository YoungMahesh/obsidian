### rclone crypt
1. Create new remote (11. Crypt) using 'rclone config' (e.g of name 'encrypted')
2. Choose path (remote or local) of crypt while configuration
3. Choose password - this password encrypts file, hence even if you created another "encrypt:"-remote with "same password and location" you can decrypt file
4. Now, when file is moved/copied using path 'encrypted:folder' then the data will be copied in encrypted-form in the original path
5. If you want to get data in decrypted form browse as `rclone lsf encrypted:`, as browsing through original location will show encrypted files only
6. Add password to 'rclone config' for more protection
