### cheatsheet

> There is no difference between `--cached` and `--staged`. They behave identically

```bash
# unstage the file, keep working copy unchanged
git restore --staged file.txt
# restore file from HEAD
git restore file.txt
# restores file from an older commit
git restore --source=HEAD~1 file.txt

# keep file locally but remove from git-tracking
git rm --staged path/to/file
# remove entire directory from staging-area
git rm -r --staged path/to/directory 
# remove file from local and git-tracking
git rm path/to/file 

git commit -m '<message>'     # move changes from staging_area to commit_area
# <message> is short text giving information about changes made in the commit
git commit --amend -m '<message>'  # move from staging_area to commit_area, but replace last-commit instead of creating new-commit
```

#### Mental model 
`git rm` is a forward-moving command
→ “From now on, this file should not exist”

`git restore` is a rollback command
→ “Put this file back how it was”

### description

Also known as **index-area**

* A **pre-commit snapshot**.
* You explicitly choose *what* goes into the next commit.
* Think of it as a **shopping cart for a commit**.

💡 Important:

* Staging lets you **commit only part of your changes**
* You can stage some files, leave others out
