```bash
git log  # view all commits in current branch
git log --oneline # view all commits without description
git log --oneline --graph --all	 # view graphical representation of all branches
git diff <commit_id> # view changes present in commit_id
git revert <commit_ID> # remove all changes in given 'commit_ID'
git reset HEAD~1  # delete last commit and move changes from last-commit to working-area
# HEAD~2 will delete latest 2 commits, HEAD~3 will delete latest 3-commits and so on..

' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
# `git filter-branch` command with an `env-filter` option, is used to rewrite the history of a Git repository in a specific way.
# `--tag-name-filter cat`: specifies how tag names should be filtered. The `cat` filter means that tag names will not be changed. This is necessary because tags are pointers to commits, and since commits are being rewritten, tags need to be adjusted to point to the new commit SHAs.
# `-- --branches --tags`: apply these changes to all branches and tags in the repository. The double dash `--` is used to separate the filter-branch options from the revision parameters.
# After running this command, all commits in the repository that were made by the `OLD_EMAIL` will now appear to have been made by `CORRECT_NAME` with `CORRECT_EMAIL`. This is a form of rewriting history and is very useful if, for example, you committed to a repo using a wrong or outdated email address.
```

### branch management
```bash
git branch <branch-name> # Create a new branch containing all git commits of current git-branch
git checkout --orphan <name>  # create a fresh branch without commits from current-branch
git branch -d <branch-name> # delete branch
git branch -m <current-name> <new-name>  # Change branch name
git checkout <branch-name> # move to another branch
git branch --all  # list all local and remote branches

git merge <branch-name> # merge branch with  <branch-name> to current branch
git merge <branch-name> --allow-unrelated-histories  # merge branch whose git-history does not match with current branch, normally used to merge changes from another repository
git merge --abort   # stop current merge process if there are conficts in merge, and you don't want to resolve them now
```

### tags management
```bash
git fetch --all --tags  # fetch all tags from remote
git checkout tags/<version> -b <branch-name>  # switch to a tag and create bracnh for it
```

### description

Also known as **Commit Area** or **HEAD**

* This is Git’s **database of commits**, stored in `.git/`
* Each commit is an **immutable snapshot**
* `HEAD` points to the **current commit**

### backup in zip-format
```bash
# current state of files in git without history (latest commit files)
# git archive -o <repo-name>.zip <branch-name>
git archive -o repository.zip HEAD
# -o == --output

# use `git bundle` to backing up entire repository with their history intact; but can just clone zip
```

### submodule
`git submodule add <remote-repsitory-link> <path to directory from root of current git-repo>`
