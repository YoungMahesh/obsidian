## cheatsheet
```bash
git status # see which files / changes present in which area # file-names in red color are in working_area
# file-names in green color are in staging_area

git diff <file_path> # see changes present in working-area
git restore <file_path>   # delete file-changes made working area
git clean -f # delete all files in working area
git clean -fd  # delete all files and directories in working area

# ------------------------ staking/index area ----------------------------------
git diff --staged # see changes in present in staging_area
git add <file_path>   # move changes (newly created files or modification in previous files) to staging area
```


## description

Also known as **Working Tree**

* This is the **actual folder on your disk**.
* You edit files here with your editor.
* Files can be:

  * **Untracked** (Git doesn’t know them yet)
  * **Modified** (tracked, but changed since last commit)

📌 Example:

```bash
vim main.py   # modifies file in working directory
```


### initiate git in working-directory
```bash
git init # create git-repository in present working directory
rm -rf .git  # remove git-repository from present-working-directory


```

[[git-config]]

### gitignore

```.gitignore
### Ignore everything except specific files ###

# Ignore everything
*

# But allow directories so Git can traverse into them
!*/

# Allow the specific directory tree
!.gitignore
!obsidian-git/
!obsidian-git/data.json
!quickadd/
!quickadd/data.json
```


### How to Set Up Directory-Specific Git User Emails

#### 1. Edit Your Global Git Config

Open your global Git config file in your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/.gitconfig
```

#### 2. Add Conditional Includes

Add the following to your `~/.gitconfig` (adjust the paths as needed):

```ini
# ... other configuration such as default editor

[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = yourglobal@email.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/x/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work
```

- `~/x/` is the path where your work projects live.
- `~/a/` is the path where your personal projects live to which your global email will get set as there is specific configuration for `a` directory.
- The trailing slash is important (`gitdir:~/x/` matches all repos under `~/x/`).

#### 3. Create the Included Config Files

**For work projects:**

```bash
nano ~/.gitconfig-work
```

Add:
```ini
[user]
    email = xyz@gmail.com
```


Now, Whenever You Create a New Repo
- If you create a repo under `~/x/`, Git will automatically use `xyz@gmail.com`.
- If you create a repo under `~/a/`, Git will automatically use `abc@gmail.com`.
